              In Bengali, 'Pohela' stands for 'first' and 'Boishakh' is first
              month of Bengali calendar. The traditional greetings for Bengali
              New Year is "Shubho Nabobarsho" which means 'Happy New Year'. On
              this day all Bengali people in Bangladesh, India and other parts
              of the world get united and celebrates with lot of color and
              festivity. As per the history of Pohela Boishakh, when the Mughal
              Emperor Akbar was collecting the tax under his reign during 1556
              to 1609, this Bengali new year celebration came into existence.
              The tax collection season was recognized, when the farmers used to
              reap of their crops from the field. At that time, the Mughal
              Emperor used to follow Arabic calendar (Hijri) for tax collection,
              which was little inconvenient for everybody. Accordingly new
              amendment from Mughal Emperor came into existence, with the
              declaration of new Bengali calendar year, where six Bengali
              seasons with their due contribution on agriculture was considered.
              From then on ward the Emperor Akbar introduced masterfully crafted
              custom of the new year celebration right after the end of
              taxpaying day. Bengali people started to celebrate this first day
              of the new year "Pohela Boishakh', in order to smoothen their
              harshness of taxpaying and propagating the better hopes in the
              coming year among all.

              Gambhira is believed to have evolved from the song, dance and
              performance forms of the Koch people residing in the Malda region.
              It is connected to local agricultural traditions, especially mango
              cultivation, and to the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. Gambhira
              dance is performed on the song of the same name. In this dance,
              there are two main dancers, who are accompanied by a chorus. The
              two main dancers perform the role of Nana (maternal grandfather)
              and Nati (grandson), respectively.

              Gombhira is one of the famous culture in the greater Rajshahi area
              in Bangladesh. As per this Gombhira, Nana and Nati has come to
              visit Florida. After coming to Florida, the Nati fell in love with
              the Bangladesh beautiful girls here. He wants Nana to find one
              Bangladesh beautiful girl for marrage so that he can settle down
              here. Nana advised him to look for a girl who owns the culture of
              Bangladesh. At one point Nati finds the girl and requests Nana to
              talk to the family. The whole Gombhira was full of fun and that
              everyone liked.
